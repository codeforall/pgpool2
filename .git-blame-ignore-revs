# As of git 2.23, git-blame supports ignoring specific commits.  This is useful
# with commits that make bulk formatting changes without truly changing any
# code.
#
# This file lists ignorable pgindent, pgperltidy, and reformat-dat-files
# related commits only.  Please don't add commits that are not in this
# category.
#
# You can use the ignore list file by running:
#
# $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# Add new entries by adding the output of the following to the top of the file:
#
# $ git log --pretty=format:"%H # %cd%n# %s" $PGINDENTGITHASH -1 --date=iso
